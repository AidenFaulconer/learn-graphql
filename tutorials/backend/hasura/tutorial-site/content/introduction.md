---

This course is a concise yet powerfully instructive introduction to setting up a GraphQL backend with Hasura.

In this course, you will learn how to set up a powerful and scalable real-time GraphQL backend complete with Queries, Mutations, and Subscriptions. You will also learn how to integrate custom business logic (in the programming language of your choise) with Hasuraâ€”both as custom GraphQL APIs that you write yourself and as Event Triggers that run asynchronously and are triggered by database events.

## What will I learn?

This course is an ideal starting point before diving into advance Hasura topics. It will help you understand Hasura basics, explore various features and learn when and how to apply them.

1. Hasura Basics: Using Hasura to generate the real-time GraphQL API powered by a PostgreSQL database
2. PostgreSQL power: Using the power of Postgres to make efficient data transformations so that we don't have to implement them in code
3. Authorization: Setting up authorization so that app users can only run operations on data that they should be allowed to
4. Authentication: Integrating a JWT based authentication provider (Auth0) with Hasura
3. Remote schemas: Adding a custom GraphQL resolver to create an API for fetching data that is not inside the database
4. Event triggers: Running custom business logic on the backend for are database events


## What am I building?

We will be building the backend of a real-time to-do app. If you're interested in building the Frontend and are new to GraphQL, head over to the [GraphQL tutorials](https://hasura.io/learn/) for different frontend frameworks.

Try the deployed version of the app, to see what features our backend needs to have:

## What do I need to follow this tutorial?

Just your browser!

However, all browser-based tasks in this tutorial can be achieved via code, be version controlled, and work with any programming language of your choice on ther server-side.

This course is designed to be less involved in the developer workflows and environment choices so that you can focus on the key concepts.
